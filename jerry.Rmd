#Summoner's Rift and Gameplay (300-400 words)
League of Legends is currently one of the most popular games in the world. It is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where the objective is to destroy the enemy team's nexus behind a series of defensive towers. There are multiple maps and gamemodes. We will be focusing on the most popular one used for esports, ranked, and competitive gameplay called Summoner's Rift. In Summoner's Rift, there are three lanes separated by two jungles with miniobjectives. Teams must work together to take down 4 tiers of defensive towers to reach and destroy the enemy nexus.

# Raw data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)

games <- read.csv("D:/Documents/Semester4/CMSC320/CMSC320FinalProject/data/games.csv") %>% 
  
head(games, 100)
```

##Exercise 1: Scatterplot
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
###Question 1: Is there a general trend (e.g., increasing or decreasing) for life expectancy across time? Is this trend linear? (answering this qualitatively from the plot, you will do a statistical analysis of this question shortly)
Yes, there is an increasing trend for life expectancy across time. I added a regression line to show this. It appears to be relatively linear except for a slight decrease in "acceleration" since 1990. This could potentially be logarithmic.

##Violin plot
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(year), y=lifeExp)) +
    geom_violin() +
    labs(title="Life expectancy over time",
         x = "year",
         y = "life expectancy")
```
